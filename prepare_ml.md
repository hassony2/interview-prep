# Objective

Get ready for ML interviews covering:
- algebra
- statistics
  - Be able to answer questions from https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/IB/Statistics/
- ML

priorities (ordered in reverse of my current weaknesses) stats > ML > Algebra

# Plan

- Find + Go through questions that I would need to answer
- Find resources which allow to refresh knowledge/ramp up fast
